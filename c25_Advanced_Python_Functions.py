'''Hands-on Map
Outline:
Write a program to return the addition of numbers
of two different lists. Then, display a list 
that is square of numbers of another list. Use 
the map() function here to get the desired 
result.

numbers1 = [1,2,3]
numbers2 = [4,5,6]
result =map(lambda x, y: x+y, numbers1,numbers2)
print("Addition of two lists")
print(list(result))

nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
def sq(n):
    return n*n
square = list(map(sq,nums))
print("Square of numbers in list")
print(square)'''


'''Zip It!
Outline:
Write a program to return - 
1. zipped list from two lists 
2. elements of two lists zipped 
together, but 2nd list in reverse order 
3. elements of two lists zipped into a dictionary

s1 = {2,3,1}
s2 = {'b','a','c'}
s3 = list(zip(s1,s2))
print(s3,"\n")

list1 = [10,20,30,40]
list2 = [100,200,300,400]

for x,y in zip(list1,list2[::-1 ]):
    print(x,y)

stocks = ['reliace','infosys','tcs']
prices = [2175,1127,2750]

new_dict = {stocks : prices for stocks, prices in zip(stocks,prices)}
print('\n{}'.format(new_dict))'''


'''That’s the exit
Outline:
Write a program where the value of i begins from 
1 and goes to 10. When the value of i becomes 5, 
force the interpreter to exit the program.'''

for i in range(10):
    if i ==5:
        print(exit)
        exit()
    print(i)
